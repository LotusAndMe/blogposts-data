# Introduction
Hello, I'm Petro! üëã 

I am a Product Engineer with strong focus on backend and I currently live in [Myrhorod, Ukraine](https://goo.gl/maps/J2bcjYx8VnM63ZfeA?coh=178571&entry=tt). This README should help you learn about me and the ways I work and how best to work with me. Feel free to chat with me about `#workwarbalance`, `#neurodiversity`, `#playbacktheatre`, `#predictability`, and `#radicaltransparency`

# Background

Git, Ruby, and RSpec have been my main tools since my career began. During the weekends, I'm [performing in the playback theatre](https://dou.ua/lenta/articles/dou-hobby-playback/) in Kyiv and [other cities of Ukraine](https://www.facebook.com/MalePlaybackUA). I've worked with [kottans.org community](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEK9H5bICxvoiDKQ7epRpxUDmQotmvsgM) in the past. I'm a passionate practitioner of ["Go Scrum Yourself"(c)(tm) framework](https://goscrumyourself.carrd.co/), UPMA‚ìá and of [ALKOframework](https://gitlab.com/nowhere-inc/tech-ninjas/alkoframework). My favorite sport is squash: commit squashing. [Feel free to schedule some talk with me](https://calendly.com/petrokoriakin/talk-to-petro?month=2023-03)

# How to collaborate with Petro

I'm a feedback-driven and context-addicted personality. I write a lot to make sure no essential details are missed. When working on a project, my creativity and ability to find **smart workarounds** followed by **boring solutions** can propel it the most. On the other hand, I dislike my unconscious focus on ü§ùcollaboration and üëÅÔ∏ètransparency instead of  üìàresults and ‚è±Ô∏èefficiency. I welcome direct, actionable feedback from customers, co-workers, code review comments, and even RSpec telling me the specs are failing. Here is the anonymous form, and I encourage you to write down some words about our cooperation https://forms.gle/j9dPdXYgV4qe4o246 

### Some feedbacks from the past:
- "You are an amazing part of our team and complete a an amazing harmony! You'll be sorely missed within Identity. A personal thank you from me for your patience, knowledge sharing, proactiveness, and a shared passion for quality! Keep up the great work not only in your future roles but in your life as well! Take care," - [Alex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-butt-piercey/), SE
- "Petr–æ helped me learn programming. He explains very clearly and easily, so that experience and professionalism can be felt behind it. It was easy to find a common language with him and achieve jointly set goals." - [Robert](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-pavlovskyi-2b2225a9/), Developer
- "it was a pleasure working with you, you were one of the best engineers I have worked with. Thank you for all of your proactiveness and helpfulness. Take care of yourself and get well üòá üòá" - [Mohammed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mshbeab/), EM
- "As QA I celebrate the issue design, it almost met the requirements and could easily pass review! @petrokoriakin1 you are rock! :)" - [Yuliia](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuliia-terentieva/), QC

### When reaching out to me, my preferences are:
- Send me an email
- Send me a 1:1 message in Slack or Discord or Linkedin etc.
- Tag me in a merge request
- Tag me in an `issue` or in `epic` or in any other `work_item`

# What does my typical working day look like?

I'm in [EET, UTC+2 or EEST, UTC+3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_European_Time) and here are some details:
- 8am - waking up, have a breakfast, walk through social media, sloowly heading out to the office space nearby.
- 9am - starting work-related activities: coffee, emails, chats, charts, etc.
- 1pm or so - lunch and loong walk. Maybe some out-of-work appointments. ~Maybe a gym.~
- 4pm or so - return to work-related activities.
- 8pm - wrap up my day, switching into nonworking mode: coffee, chats, art, volunteering. Heading out from the office space with no connection unless production incident.

~_A note #1: I tend to practice late stays and over-the-weekend learning activities. It may look a bit unhealthy... but it is definitely not for my current life stage üòá. Work enviroment is the safest place I have..._~

~_A note #2: I tend to be overexcited on some mornings and propose crazy things in slack or elsewhere. Bear with me or make a short DM with your thoughts. Simple YES/NO questions are the most valuable_~

_A note #0: I'm working on establishing better #workwarbalance habits atm. Check my progress on the [board](https://gitlab.com/petrokoriakin1/petrokoriakin1/-/boards/5432145)_
